Quick Start FILE 01

You write code to describe your command line interface. Commander looks after parsing the arguments into options and command-arguments, displays usage errors for problems, and implements a help system.

Commander is strict and displays an error for unrecognised options. The two most used option types are a boolean option, and an option which takes its value from the following argument.
