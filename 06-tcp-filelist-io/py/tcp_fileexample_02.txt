FILE 02 Data typesÂ¶

type uv_stream_t

    Stream handle type.

type uv_connect_t

    Connect request type.

type uv_shutdown_t

    Shutdown request type.

type uv_write_t

    Write request type. Careful attention must be paid when reusing objects of this type. When a stream is in non-blocking mode, write requests sent with uv_write will be queued. Reusing objects at this point is undefined behaviour. It is safe to reuse the uv_write_t object only after the callback passed to uv_write is fired.
